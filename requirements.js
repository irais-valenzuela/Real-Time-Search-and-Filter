Problem: Real-time Search and Filter

Create a real-time search and filter functionality for a list of items. You'll have a list of items, and 
you need to implement a search input that filters the items in real-time as the user types. Additionally, 
there should be filters to sort the items based on certain criteria (e.g., alphabetical order, date, etc.).

Requirements:

Display a list of items on the page.
Implement a search input that filters the items in real-time based on the input text.
Implement filters (e.g., a dropdown menu) to sort the items based on different criteria.
Make the sorting and filtering happen without a full page reload (use React state for managing the data).
Ensure a good user experience with smooth transitions and performance optimizations.
